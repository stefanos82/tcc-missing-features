# tcc-missing-features

I decided to create this repo to ask developers list all missing features from TCC so we can have them in one place.

The format should be something like

### Missing Features

- [ ] Feature Foo [C99]
- [ ] Partially implemented feature Bar [C11]

If anyone has a better suggestion, I'm open for discussion.
